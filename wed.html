        <p>A car, or an automobile, is a motor vehicle with wheels. Most definitions of cars state that they run
            primarily
            on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people, not cargo.[1][2]

            The French inventor Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built the first steam-powered road vehicle in 1769, while
            the Swiss inventor François Isaac de Rivaz designed and constructed the first internal combustion-powered
            automobile in 1808. The modern car—a practical, marketable automobile for everyday use—was invented in 1886,
            when the German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Commercial cars became widely
            available
            during the 20th century. One of the first cars affordable by the masses was the Ford Model T, begun in 1908,
            an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they
            replaced
            horse-drawn carriages.[3] In Europe and other parts of the world, demand for automobiles did not increase
            until
            after World War II.[4] The car is considered an essential part of the developed economy.</p>
